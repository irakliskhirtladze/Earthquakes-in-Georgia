# Earthquakes in Georgia

## Description
The notebook scrapes earthquake data detected in Georgia (country) then we analyze data using pandas and matplotlib
1. The records are scraped from Georgia's National Seismic Monitoring Centre website and contain data since 07.14.2021.
2. This data contains only relatively strong, mostly 3+ magnitude earthquakes detected in Georgia.
3. The recorded earthquake's epicenter may or may not be located on Georgian territory.
4. Each run of scraper will add new records (if there are any) to a 'geo_earthquakes.db'.
